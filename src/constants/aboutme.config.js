  careerFull:
    "I embarked on my journey as a self-taught developer when I was introduced to technology in 10th grade. My passion for computer science has always been there—whether it sparked when my dad first brought home a PC for my sister or when I created my first HTML page in 4th grade. The connection was always there, even if I can't pinpoint exactly when it all began.\n\nI remember the day I first started learning development it felt like I could do magic. I was always that depressed kid who was never perfect acadmically but always had a kick in him or a lot of cool ideas with programming I could make them into reality. \n\nI started learning web development. I began with the languages of Python, C, C++ along with HTML, CSS, and JS. From there on, the inguz.dev was born.",
